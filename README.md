**Contracting / Ruby / Rails Engineer - Sentinel Management Consultants**

For the last few years, I have been working as an independent contractor implementing multiple projects for Sentinel Management Consultants.

As a business that trains salespeople in the art of selling and buyers in the art of buying and negotiation, they needed to have systems implemented where they could supplement in-person training with online learning.

A new E-Learning system was implemented using Rails for the administration system where business owners could set up multiple types of course content and manage delegate registrations.

A Grape API was created on top of the data to expose the courses to multiple client applications including web and mobile.

A part of the system I am particularly proud of is the automated generation of personalised reports for delegates who participated in the training programmes. This removed the workload from the trainers who previously had written out the reports which were time-consuming and very cumbersome.

Building this system during the pandemic allowed Sentinel to continue operations when in-person meetings and business travel were not possible.

**January 2017 - April 2018**\
**Kyan, Guildford - Technical Lead / Ruby On Rails Engineer**

At Kyan, I work as the technical lead for one of three internal teams. Day to day I had the responsibility of understanding client requirements for both brownfield and greenfield projects, making sure we then implement the best technical solutions.

Working with predominantly ruby on rails, but with a mix of other languages and frameworks including Node (Express / Feathers), Python and Elixir (Phoenix), it's both fun and challenging. My work day is usually split with a mix of hands-on implementation, team management, code reviews and mentoring - I have found this diversity very rewarding especially being able to teach and mentor new software engineers.

**October 2011 - January 2017**\
**Pazam Ltd , Ashford Middlesex - Senior Ruby On Rails Engineer / Founder**

At Pazam I was responsible for all web application development and test, as well as driving the strategic direction of the company. At Pazam we developed and delivered a variety of web applications including Job Pigeon - A multi tenant job board enabling companies to own their own branded job board.

Job Pigeon has been written from the ground up using the latest development methodologies and rails best practices. One aspect of the build I am proud of is how thoroughly it is tested using behavioural specs, unit tests and also high-level functional specs with rspec, cucumber and webrat.

**April 2011 - April 2012**\
**Rawnet Ltd, Windsor, Berkshire - Senior Ruby On Rails Engineer**

At Rawnet I was responsible for all aspects of ruby web development including both green and brownfield projects. The majority of my time at the company I worked on a web application called The Digital News Agency. The Digital News Agency (DNA) is a high traffic web application that allows multiple news agencies around the globe to upload news stories. One of the more technical parts of the application is self-contained video encoding using FFMPEG. I was responsible for re-implementing the video encoding and application scalability. Scalability was a big issue when I first started to work on this project. I managed to overcome the issues by changing both the server architecture and application performance. DNA can now withstand the huge spikes in traffic that it receives when a big news story breaks.

**April 2010 – October 2010**\
**Allocate Software Ltd, London (Contract) - Senior Software Engineer**

At Allocate Software I undertook the task of taking a subset of features from their nurse staffing application and creating a HTML5, mobile compatible web application. This “sub-application” allows the nurses to post timesheets and create rosters from their phones. I had to create a high-level API on top of the main codebase in order to allow the mobile version of the site to function exactly as the full browser version does. As the application is HTML and javascript driven I used Jasmine the javascript testing framework in order to make sure the mobile version functioned correctly.

**October 2007 – April 2010**\
**Big Pink New Media Ltd, Windsor, Berkshire - Technical Architect - Development Manager**

At Big Pink my responsibilities were to oversee and work on all technical projects the company undertook for their clients. Big Pink only work in the pharmaceutical sector building applications that range from managing treatment workflows to marketing new drugs.

One of the main applications I architected and implemented was a treatment tracker for the drug Lucentis. It manages multiple patients in multiple health centres who are receiving treatment using Lucentis. If the drug was prescribed correctly within prescribing guidelines the application would reimburse the health centres for some of the cost. In return, Novartis have easily manageable performance data for the drug. The application is written in Rails and we used pure Ruby to script the high-level functional specifications.
